# white_icon_maker
App that creates an assortment of pure white icons based on given Windows desktop icons

From 2015 ive been creating white icons in Ps so the desktop looks sleeker. Ive grown tired of constant updating. This app is tailored to my needs, eg support for Steam web shortcuts (in works), separate disk drives to try and locate exes etc. 

Works by placing the app on desktop (sadly, looking for requirements yourself) and running the py file. All created icos are created in a new folder titled Processed_Icons. There are numerous methods that cover a lot of types of images to try and create the most functional one out of all that is offered.
